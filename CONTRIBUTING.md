#Scope for making pr's

I would like to keep master as relatively stable as possible.
So only update version and bug fixes, but no additional features.
There are three important reasons to do this:    
* To keep the project as relatively simple as possible.
* To keep the documentation in sync.
* To make it easy to rebase to master again.

If you would like to have your fork added to the variants section, I will be very glad to accept it.
